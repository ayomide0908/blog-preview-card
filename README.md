## My Process

### Built With
- Semantic HTML5 markup  
- CSS custom properties  
- Flexbox  

### What I Learned
I improved my ability to structure and style a simple card component using **HTML and CSS**.  
Key takeaways:
- How to use **Flexbox** for alignment.  
- Applying **hover states** for interactivity.  
- Organizing reusable CSS with custom properties.  

### Continued Development
I want to focus more on:
- Responsiveness across different devices.  
- Adding transitions/animations for a smoother UI.
